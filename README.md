### Simple Chrome extension to format Bookstrap

#### Fixes these issues:

* help button overlapping the text
* flat formatting of lists.

--------------

You know how when you have bootstrap.hackreactor.com snapped to half of the screen the help request button covers up the site content, and all the lists are smashed to the side?

Well, this simple chrome extension corrects that and makes the site more visually appealing.

Because Bookstrap can be very slow to load, the reformatting function is called at a few different intervals.


#### Install Instructions:
1. Clone repo to local system.
2. Ensure Chrome has [Developer Mode turned on](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/faq#faq-dev-01).
3. From chrome://Extensions, 'Load Unpacked Extension' and select folder from step 1.
